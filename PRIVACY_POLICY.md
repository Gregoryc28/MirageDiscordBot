# Mirage Discord Bot - Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** May 16, 2025

**1. Introduction**

This Privacy Policy describes how the Mirage Discord bot ("the Bot," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information from users ("you" or "your") who interact with the Bot on Discord.

**2. Information We Collect**

We may collect the following types of information when you use the Bot:

* **Server-Specific Information:** When the Bot is added to your Discord server, we may have access to and potentially store server-related information such as server name, server ID, channel names, and channel IDs, but only as necessary for the Bot's mirroring functionality.
* **Message Content:** To provide the mirroring service, the Bot will access and temporarily process the content of messages (including text and attachments) in designated mirrored channels. This content is processed for the sole purpose of mirroring it to other designated channels. We do not store the full content of mirrored messages permanently unless explicitly stated otherwise in a specific feature's description.
* **User Information (Related to Mirrored Content):** When mirroring messages, we may have access to and temporarily process user information associated with those messages, such as username, user ID, and avatar, to display the mirrored message correctly. This information is primarily used for attribution in the mirrored message.
* **Command Usage:** We may log the usage of certain Bot commands to understand how the Bot is being used and to improve its functionality. This may include the command used, the user who initiated it, and the server and channel where it was used.
* **Tiered Plan Information (If Applicable):** If you subscribe to a tiered plan, we may collect information necessary to manage your subscription and process payments, such as your Discord user ID, payment information (processed by a third-party payment processor, we do not directly store your full payment details), and subscription status.

**3. How We Use Your Information**

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

* **Providing the Mirroring Service:** To mirror messages, attachments, and translations between designated Discord channels as configured by server administrators.
* **Bot Functionality:** To operate and maintain the Bot, including processing commands and responding to user interactions.
* **Improving the Bot:** To analyze Bot usage and identify areas for improvement, bug fixes, and new features.
* **Managing Subscriptions (If Applicable):** To manage user subscriptions, process payments, and provide access to tiered features.
* **Communication:** To communicate with server administrators or users regarding Bot updates, support, or important announcements.

**4. Sharing Your Information**

We may share your information in the following circumstances:

* **Within Your Discord Server:** Mirrored content will be shared with the designated target channels within your Discord server as per your configuration.
* **With Third-Party Service Providers:** We may share information with third-party service providers who assist us in operating the Bot, such as payment processors or hosting providers. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your information.
* **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose information if required to do so by law, legal process, or governmental request.
* **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of the transaction. We will notify you via a prominent notice within the Bot or on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information.

**5. Data Retention**

We will retain your information only for as long as necessary to provide the Bot's services and as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Message content processed for mirroring is generally transient and not permanently stored unless related to specific features with explicit storage. Command usage logs and subscription information may be retained for a longer period for analytical and business purposes.

**6. Your Rights**

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your information, such as the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. As a Discord bot, our direct access to and storage of individual user data outside of the context of server interactions and command usage is limited. For data related to your Discord account, please refer to Discord's Privacy Policy. For data related to subscription payments, please refer to the privacy policy of our payment processor. If you have specific requests regarding data we may hold, please contact us using the information in Section 9.

**7. Children's Privacy**

The Bot is intended for users who are at least 13 years of age, consistent with Discord's Terms of Service. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information.

**8. Security**

We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

**9. Contact Us**

**10. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Bot, on our website, or by other means. Your continued use of the Bot after the effective date of any changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically for updates.
